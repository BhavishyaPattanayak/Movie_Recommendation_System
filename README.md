# Movie_Recommendation_System
Recommends movies based on their genre and year
## Overview

This movie recommendation system uses machine learning techniques to recommend movies to users based on their genre preferences and release year. The system analyzes the genre and release year of movies to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Genre-Based Recommendations:** The system takes into account the genres of movies that a user has watched and recommends other movies with similar genres.

- **Year-Based Recommendations:** The system considers the release year of movies a user has enjoyed and suggests movies released around the same time.

- **Machine Learning Model:** The recommendation engine utilizes machine learning algorithms to understand user preferences and provide accurate suggestions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhavishyaPattanayak/Movie_Recommendation_System.git
   cd Movie_Recommendation_System
## Usage

1. Input your recently watched movies along with your ratings for each movie.

2. The recommendation system will analyze the genres and release years of the movies you've watched and the ratings you've provided.

3. Based on your preferences, the system will recommend a list of movies that match your genre, year, and rating preferences.

## Example

Suppose you've recently watched and enjoyed movies like "Fight Club (1999)" (Action, Crime, Drama, Thriller) and "Pulp Fiction (1994)" (Comedy, Crime, Drama, Thriller) and you've rated them both with a high rating.

Running the recommendation system will suggest movies like "Bad Boys (1995)" (Action, Comedy, Crime, Drama, Thriller) and "Metro (1997)" (Action, Comedy, Crime, Drama, Thriller) as potential recommendations, taking into account both the genres you enjoy and your high ratings for certain movies.
